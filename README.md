README 

This file explains the script  for the final project of Getting and Cleaning Data course from JHU on coursera.com.
 
The purpose of this script is to combine, trim and clean the data from the University of California Irvine Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, as described in the instructions of the Getting and cleaning data course project by John Hopkins University on Coursera. 


The script starts with opening packages stringr and dplyr, whose functions will be used later:
```r {.line-numbers}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
```
